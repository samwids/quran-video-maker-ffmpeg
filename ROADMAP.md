# Roadmap & Work in Progress

This document tracks the current development status, known issues, and planned features for quran-video-maker-ffmpeg.

## Project Status

The project is in active development with core functionality working but many features still being refined. Expect bugs and breaking changes as we work toward a stable v1.0 release.

## Testing

This project has no testing implemented. The goal is to fix all issues starting with "Fix", then refactor the code piece by piece to support unit testing, then support integration and e2e tests. Once those steps are complete, we can create some GitHub workflows to automate build/test checks for PRs, packaging releases, and distributing to different package managers.

## Core Features (In Progress)

### Multiple Recitation Modes
**Status:** 🟡 Partially Stable

Choose between gapped (ayah-by-ayah with pauses) or gapless (continuous surah) recitation.

**Working:**
- Basic gapped mode rendering
- Basic gapless mode rendering
- Audio caching for both modes
- Mode switching via CLI

**TODOs:**
- Fix reciter download failures in both modes (e.g. Muhammad Siddiq al-Minshawi for surah-by-surah)
- Investigate and resolve timing precision issues with certain reciter data (e.g., Maher al-Muaiqly showing incorrect segments for Surah Al-Qadr).
- Improve error messages for failed downloads

### Custom Recitations
**Status:** 🔴 Highly Experimental

Use your own audio files with VTT/SRT timing files for complete flexibility.

**Working:**
- Basic VTT/SRT parsing
- Audio download from URLs
- Local audio file support
- Arabic numeral extraction from timing text

**TODOs:**
- Fix Bismillah handling not working correctly with custom audio
- Fix timing alignment issues between audio and text (e.g. reciter repeats verse or goes back a few verses and continues from there)
- Fix parser to support both Arabic/non-Arabic subtitles including non-Arabic numbers
- Improve VTT/SRT parser robustness and validation
- Add validation of timing file completeness
- Add support for verse ranges not starting at 1
- Add examples and documentation for creating timing files
- Add CLI flag to disable automatic Bismillah insertion

### Multi-language Support
**Status:** 🟡 Partially Stable

Generate videos with translations in multiple languages.

**Working:**
- English (Sahih International)
- Oromo (Gaali Abba Boor)
- Basic font rendering for each language

**TODOs:**
- Fix thumbnail generation to respect translation language
- Add more translation languages (Urdu, French, Turkish, Indonesian, etc.)
- Implement automatic font selection per language (single font per language)
- Add support for Arabic only, single translation, and two-translations subtitle tracks

### Adaptive Text Sizing
**Status:** 🟡 Partially Stable

Automatically adjusts font sizes based on verse length.

**Working:**
- Basic adaptive sizing for Arabic text
- Basic adaptive sizing for translation text
- Different size thresholds for different verse lengths

**TODOs:**
- Fix text wrapping to the next line so it doesn't rewrap (happens when text grows and it disturbs the reading experience)
- Implement size calculations to account for screen aspect ratio changes (current support is for landscape mode)
- Implement better text sizing algorithm for short, medium, and longer verses(e.g., 2:282-283). Shorter verses take up more screen space and longer verses take up space such that they don't fall off the screen.

### Text Animations
**Status:** 🟢 Stable

Optional growth animations and fade effects for enhanced visual appeal.

**Working:**
- Text growth animation for shorter verses
- Fade in/out effects
- Configurable animation parameters
- CLI flag to disable animations

**TODOs:**
- Add per-word or per-group of words highlighting synchronized with audio (tricky!)
- Implement adaptive animation timing based on recitation speed (e.g. fades slower for slower-paced reciters)
- Create simple configurable animation presets (e.g. subtle, normal, impact)

### Thumbnail Generation
**Status:** 🟢 Stable

Automatically creates thumbnails with video metadata.

**Working:**
- Thumbnail generation with surah name
- Reciter name display
- Random color selection
- Thumbnail embedded in MP4 metadata

**TODOs:**
- Support custom background image (not just video frame)
- Support using template thumbnails
- Add HD/4K thumbnail support
- Add customizable layouts
- Create separate thumbnail generation command

### Hardware Acceleration
**Status:** 🟡 Platform-Dependent (might be deprecated)

Supports both software and hardware encoders for faster rendering. This feature might be deprecated because there are a lot of complex filters applied during rendering and current benchmarks (at least on a M1 MacBook Pro) show there is no improvement and actually worse performance.

**Working:**
- macOS: VideoToolbox (h264_videotoolbox)
- Software fallback on all platforms (libx264)

**TODOs:**
- Test on Linux with NVIDIA (h264_nvenc)
- Test on Linux with AMD (h264_vaapi)
- Test on Windows platforms

### Intelligent Caching
**Status:** 🟢 Working

Downloads and caches audio files for reuse across multiple renders.

**Working:**
- Audio file caching in system temp directory
- Reuse of downloaded files
- CLI flag to bypass cache
- CLI flag to clear cache

**TODOs:**
- Implement automatic cache cleanup (currently grows indefinitely)

## Future Features (TODOs)

- Verses:
  - Add single verse previews (should create an image)
- Intelligient Backgrounds(not started):
  - Implement theme selection based on surah content/topic
  - Integrate with [Quranic topics data](https://qul.tarteel.ai/resources/ayah-topics)
  - Support user-uploadable custom backgrounds
  - Add animated backgrounds support
- Simple Video Effects(not started):
  - Add particle effects
  - Implement light rays and glows
  - Create customizable visual themes
- HLS Streaming Support(not started):
  - Generate HLS manifests for progressive playback
  - Support multiple quality renditions (720p, 1080p, 4K)
  - Ensure compatibility with web players and mobile apps
- Full Surah Automation(not started):
  - Implement automatic verse range detection
  - Add batch rendering for multiple surahs
  - Add progress tracking for long renders
