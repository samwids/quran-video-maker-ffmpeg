# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) and takes inspiration from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.2.1] - 2025-10-12

### Added
- **Verse Segmentation for Long Verses**: Break up lengthy verses into timed segments that display sequentially
  - New `--segment-long-verses` flag to enable segmentation for verses defined as "long"
  - New `--segment-data` flag to specify reciter-specific segment timing JSON file
  - New `--long-verses` flag to customize which verses are considered long (default: `metadata/long-verses.json`)
  - Automatic fallback to standard rendering when segment data is unavailable
  - Independent text layout and sizing for each segment
  - Seamless integration with existing gapless/custom audio workflows
- **Long Verses Definition File**: Added `metadata/long-verses.json` containing verse keys for extremely long verses (e.g., 2:282, 58:11)

### Changed
- **Text Layout Engine**: Added `layoutSegment()` method for laying out arbitrary text segments with duration-based growth calculations
- **Subtitle Builder**: Refactored to support mixed verse and segment dialogue generation
  - Segments are timed relative to the video timeline using absolute audio timestamps
  - Each segment receives independent adaptive sizing and wrapping
- **Video Generator**: Updated to accept optional segmentation manager for subtitle generation

### Technical
- **New Module**:
  - `verse_segmentation`: Manager class for loading long verse definitions and reciter segment data, with query methods for determining segmentation eligibility
- **Updated Modules**:
  - `text/text_layout`: Extended Engine class with segment-specific layout method
  - `subtitle_builder`: Restructured dialogue generation to handle both full verses and segments
  - `video_generator`: Plumbed segmentation manager through to subtitle generation

### Segment Data Format
Reciter segment timing files follow this structure:
```json
{
  "19:4": [
    {
      "start": 20.22,
      "end": 24.5,
      "arabic": "قَالَ رَبِّ إِنِّي وَهَنَ ٱلۡعَظۡمُ مِنِّي",
      "translation": "He said, \"My Lord, indeed my bones have weakened",
      "is_last": false
    },
    {
      "start": 24.76,
      "end": 35.0,
      "arabic": "وَٱشۡتَعَلَ ٱلرَّأۡسُ شَيۡبٗا...",
      "translation": "and my head has filled with white...",
      "is_last": true
    }
  ]
}

## [0.1.4] - 2025-11-26
### Changed
- Fixed videos not looping.

## [0.1.2 - 0.1.3] - 2025-11-26
### Changed
- Added Windows support.
- Documented CI-tested platforms (Ubuntu 24.04, macOS 15 arm64, Windows Server 2025) and Windows setup expectations in the README.
- Hardened Windows smoke render by normalizing/escaping FFmpeg filter paths so `ass`/`fontsdir` arguments parse correctly.
- Release workflow now reuses CI-produced binary artifacts (no data/assets bundled); data stays external via `data.tar` download.
- Added a Scoop manifest template (`scoop/qvm.json`) for Windows.
- Released 0.1.2 during testing of workflows

## [0.1.1] - 2025-11-25
### Changed
- Replaced Git LFS with a direct download of test data from R2 storage bucket; docs/workflows updated accordingly and zipped data handling removed.
- Enabled built-in RTL handling for subtitles, removing manual reshaping hacks and simplifying text layout code paths.
- Refined config path resolution for clearer override behavior.
- Strengthened CI by adding ffmpeg installation plus a smoke render that checks both the video and generated thumbnail after unit tests.
- Clarified installation instructions in README for manual setups.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-22
### Added
- First public release of the `quran-video-maker-ffmpeg` CLI for producing Quran verse videos with synchronized Arabic text, translations, and recitations.
- Gapped rendering pipeline for surah ranges; gapless workflows supported only with user-supplied audio and timing files while built-in gapless data stays disabled.
- Custom recitation inputs via `--custom-audio` and `--custom-timing` (VTT/SRT) with automatic Bismillah insertion and verse-range trimming that keeps late verses aligned.
- Multi-language translations (English, Oromo, Amharic, Urdu) with localized surah labels, reciter names, numerals, and thumbnail/intro text.
- Styling and quality controls in `config.json` plus CLI overrides for fonts, padding, animation toggles, encoders, CRF/bitrate knobs, and named quality profiles.
- Text growth and fade animations with adaptive sizing/wrapping to keep long ayat on-screen.
- Thumbnail generation with randomized color themes and metadata embedding.
- Render metadata sidecars that capture the exact CLI invocation and config artifact, plus structured progress output when `--progress` is enabled.
- Audio download caching with flags to reuse or clear the cache; optional VideoToolbox hardware acceleration on macOS.
- Homebrew tap install (`brew install ashaltu/tap/qvm`) and a starter unit test suite covering config loading, timing parsing, and reciter utilities.

### Known limitations
- Built-in gapless datasets remain disabled pending timing cleanup; gapless renders require providing custom audio and timing files.
- Hardware acceleration is untested on Linux and Windows.
- Build/test coverage: verified on macOS; Linux builds have only light smoke testing; Windows builds and tests have not been done yet.
